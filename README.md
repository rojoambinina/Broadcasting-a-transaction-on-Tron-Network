# Broadcasting a transaction on Tron Network
## The Crypto Reverse-Scam You Ought to Beware

For several months, I have seen people posting their passphrases and private keys of their TRX addresses with balances of several thousand USDT on social networks to trick people and harvest TRX. They pretend to have no money left, and encourage you to send some TRX.

#### Hereâ€™s my private key crypto scam

Many people have been deceived by these scammers, I have checked and seen that the trap address generates a lot of transaction. 
If you send some amount of TRX to this trap address (e.g. TGEbBaHpoVXbLzbo1heSENn2GjThAFgT2n), the balance will be immediately transferred to another TRX address. And you will never have enough TRX fees to transfer those thousands of USDT already promised. At the same time, the address is protected by Multisig, a second TRX address is needed to approve each transfer or withdrawal.

To put into practice everything I said above, I coded a small script that instantly broadcasts transactions on Trons networks. 
I leave the private key "**8386338e8b18c8f2ec2089fcc8991b396afa9f0ad668555461d8736bd4d23c08**" and the TRX address "**TGEbBaHpoVXbLzbo1heSENn2GjThAFgT2n**" within the code, so that you can test on Tron Mainnet or Tron Nile networks.

## Usage
Open you terminal and type the command below to install Tronpy and Colorama modules.

#### pip install tronpy

You go to the folder where the python file is, and type the command below to launch the script.

#### py broadcast-transaction.py
